# HTML_PARROT_MADNESS
a stupid website made in an hour that just spams popups of parrots

this website simply spamms a bunch of popups of a rainbow parrot dancing
after about 16 popups are opened it will stop and give you an option to close it

if you dont like your screen getting filled by parrots no problem! you can click the single parrot option to spawn a small window with a parrot in it :)

fr tho this repo was made for fun please dont use the code for bad

the website wass made in an hour and get fixed a bit over a bit longer
